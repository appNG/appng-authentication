== Login Mechanisms
=== Form based Login
This is the default login mechanism requiring a username and a password. Both are managed in the appNG manager application.

=== Digest Login
The digest login offers a digest based authentication.

External applications that do know about a the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_secret[shared secret] can use this to generate a parameterized URL that automatically signs in the user. Therefore a digest of the following form is needed:
`{user}|{yyyyMMddHHmmss}|{utc-offset}|{hash}`.

*Example:*
`admin|20160114120555|+01:00|1D87C8A5E738BD3015AC57F2D9B862A5`

The `{hash}` is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5[MD5] hash of `{user}|{timestamp}|{utc-offset}|{shared-secret}`, where `{shared-secret}` comes from the *platform property* `sharedSecret`.

To enable digest-login, you have to set the following *site properties*:

* `authApplication` = `appng-authentication` 
* `authLoginPage` = `digestlogin`
* `authLoginRef` = `login`

A valid digest login URL looks like

http://www.yourdomain.com/manager?digest=johndoe|20160114121044|%2B01%3A00|1D87C8A5E738BD3015AC57F2D9B862A5

You can also parameterize a deep-link with the `digest` parameter:
http://localhost:8080/manager/site/application/page/action/1?digest=johndoe|20160114121044|%2B01%3A00|1D87C8A5E738BD3015AC57F2D9B862A5

*Note that the digest parameter needs to be* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding[URL encoded]*.*

[TIP]
====
If `digestlogin` is not the first entry listed in `authLoginPage`, you need the directly address the digest login like this:

http://localhost:8080/manager/site/appng-authentication/digestlogin?digest=johndoe|20160114121044|%2B01%3A00|1D87C8A5E738BD3015AC57F2D9B862A5
*Also note that it's not possible to do a deep link to another application*

=== NTLM Login
This login method uses https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa378749%28v=vs.85%29.aspx[Microsoft NTLM] to sign in a user with it's windows domain account.
It requires the https://github.com/dblock/waffle[WAFFLE Authentication Framework] to be installed and configured properly. Note that both the appNG server and also the client machines must be running under Microsoft Windows.
